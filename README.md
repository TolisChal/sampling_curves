#### Supplementary code for the paper "On the sampling error for parametric curves", Apostolos Chalkis, Christina Katsamaki, Josue Tonelli-Cueto, 2022.

### Installation

Run the script `install.m` to add to the path the required directories.

### Usage

To use the implementation, you have to give:  
(i) The coefficients of each univariate polynomial with a matrix that contains them row-wise.  
(ii) The domain of the curve with an interval [a,b].  
(iii) The number of uniformly distributed points you want to generate.  

For an example open and run the script `example`.

### Experiments

To reproduce the experiments presented in the paper run the script `experiments`.
